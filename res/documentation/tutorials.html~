		<h2>From the main menu:</h2>

		<p>To begin completing boards, click on the <strong>Board List</strong> button from the Main Menu.</p>
		<img src="img/mainMenu.jpg" />

		<p>Select a board you would like to attempt; the first board shown, "Light the Bulb," is recommended to learn the user-interface. You can navigate through 
		the boards by pressing <strong>Next</strong> to proceed to the next page, and <strong>Previous</strong> to return to the previous page.</p>

		<p>You can attempt a board by pressing the <strong>Attempt</strong> button underneath a board's information.</p>

		<p>Once in the board editor (the interface shown after clicking the <strong>Attempt</strong> button), there are numerous sections to be mindful of:</p> 
		<ul>
			<li><p><strong>BACK TO BOARD LIST button:</strong> Located in the top left of the window. This button can be used to return to the list of available boards.</p></li>			
			<li><p><strong>Information section:</strong> located in the top right of the window. This section provides the title of the board, as well as a description, describing the 
			actions needed to complete the board.</p></li>
			<li><p><strong>Board:</strong> this panel is in the center of the window, occupying slightly more space on the left side. It contains the graphical representation of the board, 
			and it is the panel you click when wanting to place a component (click in the desired grid-cell).</p></li>
			<li><p><strong>Legend:</strong> located on the right side of the window. This panel provides a list of components already on the board, as well as their values (in brackets).
			 Specific components can be found by looking at the character and its count on the legend, such as "R1", and looking for it at the top-right of a component's grid-cell. This 
			 will be particularly important when needing to provide components with specific values.</p></li>
			<li><p><strong>The score section:</strong> located at the bottom left, it contains the user's score (the number of misplaced components), and the number of components which have 
			been successfully placed.</p></li>
			<li><p><strong>The navigation used to select components:</strong> located at the bottom of the window, to the right of the score section. It has a drop-down menu used to 
			split the components into categories. Below the drop-down menu there is the selected page's components. The user can click the drop-down menu to display a desired category of 
			components, and click on a component button to select it for placing on the board.</p></li>
			<li><p><strong>Input component buttons:</strong> certain component buttons contain an input-field to provide a value for the component being placed. Enter a value into the field, 
			and click the button to use the entered value. These need only be used when the component needs a particular value.</p></li>
		</ul>

		<h2>How to complete a board:</h2>
		<p>To successfully complete a board you must correctly place all of the missing components in the right locations. To do this, you must click a board's <strong>Attempt</strong> 
		button, and select a correct component from the component navigation (by clicking it) and placing it in the correct location on the board (by clicking a grid-cell). You must do this 
		until all necessary components have been placed. If an incorrect component is placed on the board, or a correct component in the incorrect location, the <strong>Misplaced</strong> 
		counter is incremented. If a correct component is placed in the correct location, and it is not the final component, the <strong>Successfully placed components</strong> counter 
		will be incremented. If all needed components are placed in the correct location, the progress is saved, the board is marked as completed, and the user is returned to the list of 
		boards.</p>
