		<h1>Installation Guide</h1>
		
		<h2>Requirements:</h2>
		<ul class="large-list">		
			<li><h3>JDK and JRE</h3></li>
			<li><h3>(Optional) IDE--example uses Eclipse</h3></li>
			<li><h3>Archiving program, able to extract the archived files (in RAR format).</h3></li>
			<li><h3>Computer specifications capable of handling minimal graphics and file processing</h3></li>
		</ul>
		
		<br />
		<h2>Installation:</h2>
		<p><em>This installation guide is based on the Eclipse IDE; the set-up should, however, be similar for other IDEs.</em></p>
		<p>Open a File Manager, and locate your IDE's workspace directory. For Linux, Eclipse's workspace directory is located at <strong><em>/home/*User*/workspace</em></strong>.
		Place the downloaded RAR file in the workspace directory, and extract it.</p>
		<p>Open your IDE and import the project. In Eclipse one can do this by going to: <strong>File > Import > General > Existing Projects into Workspace > Next > Browse (Select root 
		directory)</strong>, selecting the extracted file, pressing <strong>OK</strong>, and finally pressing <strong>Finish</strong>. If your IDE is not Eclipse this process 
		will be different, as you will need to import all of the JAVA files, and create a similar file structure (including the resources, and fonts) in your IDE's workspace. If 
		compiling in a different IDE, important folders include: <strong>src, res, bin/fonts</strong>.</p>
		<p>In Eclipse the program can be run by going to: <strong>Run > Run</strong>. This process will be similar for most other IDEs.</p>
